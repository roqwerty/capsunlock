# CapsUnlock
**Reclaim your CapsLock!**

CapsUnlock is an all-in-one keystroke and hotkey replacement engine to make Capslock into an actually useful key on the keyboard.
In addition, this aims to provide modern upgrades and future-focused functionality that is at home in our world today.

To use, simply run the python script. CapsUnlock will override your CapsLock's default behavior, adding a list of hotkeys and making it behave as a standard modifier key (like Shift, Ctrl, and Alt).
Help text and a full hotkey list are printed when the program is run.
